## Understanding Specific Industries

It is essential to have a good understanding of the industry you are building prompts for to create effective prompts. Each industry has unique trends, language, and challenges.

For instance, in the healthcare industry, users may have specific medical terms that require explanations. In finance, the prompts may need to have a better understanding of economic terms and necessary financial calculations.

## Creating the Prompts

When creating prompts, it's important to understand the industry's challenges and create prompts that provide solutions. The prompts should be relevant, helpful, and informative. They should also be engaging and entertaining.

Remember that the tone and language you use should match the industry you're creating prompts for. Be careful not to confuse the user by using language that they may not be familiar with.

Protip: Before designing prompts for specific industries, it is advisable to speak to industry experts and ask for their insights into the industry trends and language.

Sample response:
`12% per annum`

ChatGPT Response:
`If you take a loan of $10,000 at 12% per annum for a term of 36 months, you'll pay $334 per month. Would you like me to provide more information on loans?`
